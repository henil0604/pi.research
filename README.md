# π.Research

This Repository Contains Research done by me On PI. I have many ideas how PI may have patterns in the digits. I will try to do some research based on given Laws by Mathematicians.

**NOTE: In this Whole Research Every Javascript File should be run using [`zx`](https://github.com/google/zx) because it provides wrapper for Javascript and it is easy with Research**
