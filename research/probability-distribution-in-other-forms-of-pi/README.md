# Probability Distribution in other forms of PI

PI is always been a mystery. The randomness it the digits of PI has never been random. PI's digits are Infinite and the probability comes out to be at equilibrium at all time.

Today i collected probability distribution data for `1/PI`, `PI^2`, `PI^3`, `PI^(1/2)` and found out that those probability distribution were also at equilibrium.

For Example, `1/PI` form with 100000 digits of PI, all the number's probability to be found was tending towards `10%`. Similarly in `PI^(1/2)`.

In `PI^2` the total digits happens to be twice of the provided number of digits. so the probability also happens to be twice of `10%`.

In `PI^3` the total digits happens to be thrice of the provided number of digits. so the probability also happens to be thrice of `10%`.

This Gives us a pretty good idea of Infinite Set. My theory is that `In every Infinite set, probability of finding any element is same.`. This answers some of unanswered questions like `Is Universe Infinite?`; If you can prove that probability of finding a human and probability of finding a Hydrogen atom is same, then i would consider the answer to be `Yes`, but today that is not proven so the answer is `No`.
