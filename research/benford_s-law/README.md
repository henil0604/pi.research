# Benford's Law

According to [Benford's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford%27s_law), In any general set of numbers there is probability distribution of numbers.

So in this Research I will apply this law on digits of π.

* This Law is more accurate on larger sets of numbers

## Probability Distribution

While Researching i tested on these sets:
- 1 Thousand
- 10 Thousand
- 100 Thousand
- 1 Million

I found the distribution chart as shown above.

This was also discussed at [SAS Blog](https://blogs.sas.com/content/iml/2015/03/12/digits-of-pi.html). They had same probability distribution data with 10 Million Digits
